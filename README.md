# Sentiment AI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Author: Jessica Laporte

I chose the sentiment API from Open AI. Go to the link below and enter a sentence to know its sentiment or you can also click on the emojis (or try your own) ðŸŽ‰

## Deployment

This app is deployed on Netlify [https://jessica-sentiment-ai.netlify.app/](https://jessica-sentiment-ai.netlify.app/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
